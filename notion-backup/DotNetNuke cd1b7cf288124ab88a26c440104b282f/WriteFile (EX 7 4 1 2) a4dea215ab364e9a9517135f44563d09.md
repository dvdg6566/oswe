# WriteFile (EX 7.4.1.2)

*The original Mu√±oz and Mirosh presentation includes a reference to the DNN WriteFile
function, which can be used to disclose information from the vulnerable DNN server.
Generate an XML payload that will achieve that goal.*

Just as with loadfile, we can search up the implementation of writeFile. The code takes the argument `strFileName`, reads the file and injects it into the current `HttpContext.Current.Response`. As such, successfully triggering this function would inject the file contents into our HTTP response, allowing us to gain arbitrary file read. 

```java

[Obsolete("Deprecated in DNN 6.0.")]
public static void WriteFile(string strFileName)
{
	HttpResponse response = HttpContext.Current.Response;
	Stream stream = null;
	try
	{
		stream = new FileStream(strFileName, FileMode.Open, FileAccess.Read, FileShare.Read);
		FileSystemUtils.WriteStream(response, stream);
	}
	catch (Exception ex)
	{
		FileSystemUtils.Logger.Error(ex);
		response.Write("Error : " + ex.Message);
	}
	finally
	{
		if (stream != null)
		{
			stream.Close();
			stream.Dispose();
		}
	}
}
```
