## Blackbox Testing

Discern when to continue investigating particular features and when to move on.

- SQL Syntax error obviously suggests presence of SQL injection vulnerability. However, unlike in white box testing, we canâ€™t just reference the code and check for proper escaping. This is significantly harder in a blackbox.

Discovery phase is critical to build a proper sitemap to obtain a view of exposed endpoints and application libraries.
