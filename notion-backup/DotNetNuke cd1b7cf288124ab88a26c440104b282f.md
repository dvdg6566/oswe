# DotNetNuke

*Analysis and exploitation of deserialization RCE vulnerability in the DotNetNuke platform through maliciously crafted cookies, focusing on .NET deserialization process and then XMLSerializer class.* 

Serialization is the process of converting the state of an object into a form that can be persisted or transported (a bit like jsonifying our current state to store as hard disk files). As long as format of saved file is understood by consumer, object can be **recreated** in process space as desired.
