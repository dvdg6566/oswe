# Discovery

We start by performing a directory fuzz against the concord server. 

```bash
gobuster dir -u http://concord:8001 -w ~/SecLists/Discovery/Web-Content/common.txt -t 40
```

All discovered routes apart from css, js and media return 401 unauthorized messages. Applications typically present a **small footprint** to unauthorized users. 

When we look at traffic in burp suite, we notice an API request to the endpoint `/api/service/console/whoami`. This seems interesting and warrants further investigation. Based on the name of the route, it looks like the request returns information about the authenticated user, and since we are unauthenticated, it is an empty result.

However, the `Access-Control` headers are interesting, since they instruct the browser to grant specific origins access to specific resources with the Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) standard.
